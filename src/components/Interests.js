            Apart from being a web/mobile developer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors and playing music.

            When forced indoors, I follow a number of series, comedy genre movies 
            and documentaries. Also I spend a large amount of my free time exploring 
            the latest technology advancements in the mobile and front-end web development world.
