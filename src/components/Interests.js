        <p>
          Apart from being a web/mobile developer, I enjoy most of my time being
          outdoors and playing music.

        <p className="mb-0">
          When forced indoors, I follow a number of series, comedy genre movies
          and documentaries. Also I spend a large amount of my free time
          exploring the latest technology advancements in the mobile and
          front-end web development world.
